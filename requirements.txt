# Clean up any Conda-specific dependencies if they aren't strictly needed 
# by your code and are only in the environment for performance/default setup.
# If your ML pipeline relies on the mkl optimized libs, they should be
# managed by the host environment (e.g., in a full Conda installation).
# For standard pip installs, keep the core libraries above.
